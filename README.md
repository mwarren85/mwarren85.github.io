## Who I am

A software engineer for 18 years, moving into a technical and managerial lead for the last 4 years.

I have a strong passion for building software that solves valuble real world problems for users. I love facilatating open and engaging communication with the engineering teams and the wider business.

Having recently moved away from full technical role, I am able to use previous experience of a technical lead to engage with, and help guide teams where necessary.

## What do I bring

Coaching and mentoring individuals to grow as developers, building skills beyond programming, to be able to influence their teams and the business as a whole.

Setting up the processes and habits of high functioning teams. Allowing for fast, iterative delivery of robust code. Using the [four key devops metrics](https://www.atlassian.com/devops/frameworks/devops-metrics) to measure and improve performance.

I have experience and knowledge in architecting scalable distributed systems, problem solving issues of concurrency, resource management, micro-service management, etc.

## What do I value most

Communication is key, to be as open and honest as possible, using ideals of *no mercy, no malice* and [Radical Candor](https://www.supersummary.com/radical-candor/summary/).  

Giving individuals [Purpose and Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc) of their skills. Allowing them to motivate themselves, and those around them.

Working closely with all parts of the business in figuring out what is the most valuble product for the customer.

The continuous releasing of code. Having every commit going to production, and the level of quality, automation, agility, and maturity that is gained by reaching it successfully.

## What are my personality quirks

Being very direct and engaging, I care fiercely for those I manage.

Not being risk averse, using any issues or problems as a learning experience to grow.
